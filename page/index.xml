I graduated with a Bachelor’s in Mathematics from the University of Chicago in 2020. I’m currently living the Start-Up Nation dream in Israel, working at NextSilicon on embedded algorithms for compilers.
I moved to Jerusalem from Montreal, Canada at the age of 12. Even though I was able to pick up conversational Hebrew, classes were a struggle. Math and science became my natural comfort zone.</description></item></channel></rss>
