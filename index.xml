      <title>What is convergence?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.appliedintheory.com/article/easy-stability/&#34; title=&#34;Post: Easy signs of stability&#34;&gt;previous post on stability&lt;/a&gt;,
we saw a few familiar properties that indicate stability in the system.
However, what we really mean when we are looking for stability is a system that is robust to small rounding errors.
In other words, we want convergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By exploring fixed points,
we will be able to properly define what this means,
and build an intuition for what convergence looks like.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Easy indications of a stable system</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some systems can be easily identified as stable, and not chaotic.
In these special cases we can easily find hints that indicate that we can sleep easily at night knowing
that our system is well behaved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our purposes, &lt;em&gt;stable&lt;/em&gt; simply means that rounding errors do not change the output drastically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going to look at a few types of stable dynamics that are very good indications that
what we expect is actually happening.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Logistic map code</title>
      <link>https://www.appliedintheory.com/code/logistic-map/</link>

      <description>I use the logistic map with various r values to show different dynamics.
Note that in this example I set r = 3.95.
For those who want to check my work (or experiment themselves), the data in the following figure was generated with this code, and I used matplotlib.pyplot.scatter to generate the figure.
If you do change the r value, I suggest also playing with the t value, to see the system evolve over time.</description>

      <title>Chaos 101: a small change in input is a BIG change in output</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many systems are chaotic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some are only interesting to physics classes, like the double pendulum.
Some, like the three-body problem, are concrete physics problems that feel a bit more important.
However, the weather is also a highly chaotic system,
and the fact that weather prediction is so complex has an immediate effect on all of our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
