      <title>Easy signs of a stable system</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Luckily, some systems can be easily identified as stable.
In these cases we can easily find hints that indicate that we can sleep easily at night knowing
that our system is well behaved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our purposes, &lt;em&gt;stable&lt;/em&gt; simply means that rounding errors do not change the output drastically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going to look at a few types of stable dynamics that are very good signs that
what we expect is actually happening.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Logistic map code</title>
      <link>https://www.appliedintheory.com/code/logistic-map/</link>

      <description>I use the logistic map with various r values to show different dynamics.
Note that in this example I set r = 3.95.
For those who want to check my work (or experiment themselves), the data in the following figure was generated with this code, and I used matplotlib.pyplot.scatter to generate the figure.
If you do change the r value, I suggest also playing with the t value, to see the system evolve over time.</description>

      <title>Chaos 101: a small change in input is a BIG change in output</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many systems are chaotic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some are only interesting to physics classes, like the double pendulum.
Some, like the three-body problem, are concrete physics problems that feel a bit more important.
However, the weather is also a highly chaotic system,
and the fact that weather prediction is so complex has an immediate effect on all of our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
