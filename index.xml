      <description>I use the logistic map with various r values to show different dynamics.
Note that in this example I set r = 3.95.
For those who want to check my work (or experiment themselves), the data in the following figure was generated with this code, and I used matplotlib.pyplot.scatter to generate the figure.
If you do change the r value, I suggest also playing with the t value, to see the system evolve over time.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many systems are chaotic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some are only interesting to physics classes, like the double pendulum.
Some, like the three-body problem, are concrete physics problems that feel a bit more important.
However, the weather is also a highly chaotic system,
and the fact that weather prediction is so complex has an immediate effect on all of our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
