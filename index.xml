Note that in this example I set r = 3.95.
For those who want to check my work (or experiment themselves), the data in the following figure was generated with this code, and I used matplotlib.pyplot.scatter to generate the figure.
If you do change the r value, I suggest also playing with the t value, to see the system evolve over time.</description></item><item><title>Chaos 101: a small change in input is a BIG change in output</title><link>lia-troy.github.io/article/chaos101/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2022 08:46:10 +0300</pubDate><guid>lia-troy.github.io/article/chaos101/</guid><description>&lt;p>Many systems are chaotic.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Some are only interesting to physics classes, like the double pendulum.
Some, like the three-body problem, are concrete physics problems that feel a bit more important.
However, the weather is also a highly chaotic system,
and the fact that weather prediction is so complex has an immediate effect on all of our daily lives.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
